:+1::tada: Thanks a lot! :tada::+1:

Contributing to this project should be easy whether it's:

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Install the dependencies (`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`) and also the test/lint suite (`python3 -m pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov black`).
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`python3 -m pytest --cov=yaml_resume tests`).
5. Make sure your code lints using flake8.
6. Install and enable pre-commit (`python3 -m pip install pre-commit`, then `pre-commit install`) to ensure styleguides and codechecks are followed.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL-3.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/notsag/yaml-resume/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/notsag/yaml-resume/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
